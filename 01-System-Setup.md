## System Setup Recommendations and Tips

This is a guide to setting up a new computer before installing and using [HOOMD-blue] for colloids simulations in the [PRoPS Group].

This guide is optimized for MacOS and was last updated in August 2021.

The standard implementation of HOOMD-blue was adapted for our colloids simulations by Mohammad (Nabi) Nabizadeh. This guide was compiled by Rob Campbell.
