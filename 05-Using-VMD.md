# Using VMD

This is a brief introduction to using [VMD] to visulaize the results of [HOOMD-blue] colloids simulations for research in the [PRoPS Group].

See [Simulating waterDPD](https://github.com/rob10campbell/PRoPS-colloids_setup/blob/main/03-Simulating-waterDPD.md) for more details on running a simulation with HOOMD-blue and the [VMD Installation Guide](https://github.com/rob10campbell/PRoPS-colloids_setup/blob/main/04-VMD-Install-Guide.md) for help installing VMD.

This guide is optimized for MacOS.

[Last Updated: August 2021].

The standard implementation of HOOMD-blue was adapted for our colloids simulations by Mohammad (Nabi) Nabizadeh. This guide was compiled by Rob Campbell.
