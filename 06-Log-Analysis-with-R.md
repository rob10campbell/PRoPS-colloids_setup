# Postprocessing in R

This is a guide to setting up R for post-processing data generated by [HOOMD-blue] colloids simulations in the [PRoPS Group].

See Simulating waterDPD for help running a colloids simulation with HOOMD-blue.

This guide is optimized for MacOS and was last updated August 2021.

The standard implementation of HOOMD-blue was adapted for our colloids simulations by Mohammad (Nabi) Nabizadeh. Nabi also created the initial scripts for post-processing with R. This guide was compiled by Rob Campbell.
