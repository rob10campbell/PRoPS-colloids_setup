# Getting Setup with the Discovery Cluster

This is a guide to getting setup to use the Discovery Cluster at Northeastern University for research in the [PRoPS Group] simulating colloids with [HOOMD-blue].

This guide is optimized for MacOS and was last updated August 2021.

The standard implementation of HOOMD-blue was adapted for our colloids simulations by Mohammad (Nabi) Nabizadeh. This guide was compiled by Rob Campbell.
