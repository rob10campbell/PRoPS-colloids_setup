    "\n",
    "Required for installation:\n",
    "* MacOS or Linux (this guide is optimized for MacOS)\n",
    "* C++17 capable compiler (HOOMD-blue v3.1 is tested with gcc 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and clang 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13)\n",
    "* CMake >= 3.9\n",
    "* Eigen >= 3.2\n",
    "* pybind11 >= 2.2\n",
    "* Python >= 3.6\n",
    "* NumPy >= 1.7\n",
    "\n",
    "For MPI parallel execution\n",
    "* MPI (HOOMD-blue v3.1 is tested with OpenMPI, MVAPICH)\n",
    "* cereal >= 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Both clang and gcc should be included with Xcode on MacOS. MacOS also includes Python 2, but you will need to install Python 3 separately. Python 3 and the other prerequisites can be installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or another package manager (NumPy and pybind11 are also easily installed for Python using pip, see note on virtual environments below). \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: It is not recommended to install HOOMD-blue prerequisites with conda. See the* [HOOMD-blue](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) *installation page for advice on using conda.*"
