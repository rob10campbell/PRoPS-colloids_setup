# Programming Resources

This is a collection of programming resources that can help you get started with the tools you need to do research in the [PRoPS Group] simulating colloids with [HOOMD-blue].

Our simulations use a variety of tools and programming languages. All of us were new to at least some of these things when we started working in the PRoPS group, and we're still exploring new things that might make our research easier/better! This directory contains some general resources (either online or as PDFs) that have been useful for learning these skills.

## Best Practices for Collaborating on Code

* [Stealing Google's Coding Practices for Academia]<br>
A 2016 blogpost on the differences between academic code and production code, making an argument for best practices for collaborative programming in academic research: style guides, tooling, code review, pair programming, and open source.

* [Reproducible research: Goals, Guidelines and Git]<br>
Slides from a 2019 Princeton workshop with an overview of reproducible research best practices and a guide to setting up Git (geared towards bioinformatics, but still useful)

* [Making READMEs Readable]<br>
Best practices for open-source READMEs/documentation
