For programming resources to help you with the command line, VIM, Python, R, C++, and other skills that are useful for our work, see the [Programming Resources folder](/Programming-Resources).

For advice on choosing and setting up a workstation for HOOMD-blue simulations, see the [System Setup folder](/System-Setup)

The rest of the guides are numbered to follow the steps for getting set up with HOOMD-blue, VMD, and other related tools for running and analyzing simulation data:
1. [The HOOMD-blue Installation Guide](/01-HOOMDblue-Install-Guide.md)
2. The guide to running HOOMD-blue simulations: [Simulating waterDPD](/02-Simulating-waterDPD.md)
3. [The VMD Installation Guide](/03-VMD-Install-Guide.md)
4. [The Guide to Using VMD](/04-Using-VMD.md)
5. The adavnced guide to VMD (to be added)
6. The guide to analyzing `.log` files in R: [Log Analysis with R](/06-Log-Analysis-with-R) (in progress)
7. [The Guide to Accessing the Discovery Cluster](/07-Accessing-Discovery.md)
8. The Guide to Running Simulations on Discovery (to be added)

Additional files can be added in the future, as needed.
