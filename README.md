## Before you Begin

The [System Setup folder](/System-Setup) contains information for choosing a laptop or other workstation and steps for setting up a new MacOS computer before installing HOOMD-blue.

The [Programming Resources folder](/Programming-Resources) contains a variety of resources that can help you with the command line, VIM, Python, R, C++, Git/Github, and other skills that are useful for our work.

Once you have received your computer, the remaining files should help you install HOOMD-blue and VMD and give you the information you need to get started with colloids simulations!
