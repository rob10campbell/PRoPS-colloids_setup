## Guide to Working with Simulations

This is a guide for running a colloids simulations with [HOOMD-blue] for research in the [PRoPS Group].

This guide is optimized for MacOS and was last updated August 2021.

See the HOOMD-blue Installation Guide for prerequisites.

The standard implementation of HOOMD-blue was adapted for our colloids simulations by Mohammad (Nabi) Nabizadeh. This guide was compiled by Rob Campbell.

# Running a Simple Simulation

Start by running a simple dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation of particles in water.
